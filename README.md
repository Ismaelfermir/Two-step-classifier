We made a simplified genetic classification based on those proposed by Schmitz-Wright and Lacy. We used the alterations of specific genes to classify the samples as N1, BN2, EZB, MCD, or ST2. The A53 subtype was not included due to the lack of copy number variation data in our series or most published series. We developed a two-step classification method. Genes were assigned at each step according to their specificity determined by the Fisherâ€™s exact test as featured in Wright and Lacy studies. In the first step, at least one of the top genes is mutated: NOTCH1 for N1 (all samples with mutations in NOTCH1 were classified as N1, irrespective of the presence of other alterations), MYD88, CD79B, and PIM1 for MCD; BCL6 translocation, NOTCH2, BCL10, and TNFAIP3 mutations for BN2; BCL2 (mutation and/or translocation), EZH2, and CREBBP for EZB; SGK1, TET2, and SOCS1 for ST2. Those samples with the same score for two or more subtypes, or samples with no mutations, were classified in the second step. In this step, we added the following genes for each subtype: PRMD1, BTG1, PIM2, and CD58 for MCD; UBE2A, CD70, CCND3, and DTX1 for BN2; TNFRSF14, KMT2D, IRF8, and EP300 for EZB, and STAT3 for ST2.  For this step, at least two genes from any of the genes that define each subtype should be mutated to assign the sample to the corresponding subtype.
